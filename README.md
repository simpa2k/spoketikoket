# spoketikoket

The code for the website of the excellent, pan-traditional multi-headed folk music monstrosity that is Spöket i Köket. The public part of
the site is mostly a postcard page. However, some work has gone into the admin part of the page which unfortunately cannot be seen publicly.

The website can be seen at www.spoketikoket.com.
