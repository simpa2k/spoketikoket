The code for the website of the excellent, pan-traditional multi-headed folk music monstrosity that is Spöket i Köket. The public part of
the site is mostly a postcard page. The work that has gone into this site lies mostly in the admin system which cannot be seen publicly.
The code, however, is available here for reading.

The backend is based on examples from an excellent series of blog posts by Lorna Jane at:

The website can be seen at www.spoketikoket.com.
